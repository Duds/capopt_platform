# Security Standards for High-Risk Industries

## Security Philosophy
- **Security by Design:** Security integrated into every layer of the architecture
- **Defence in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege:** Users and systems have minimum necessary access
- **Zero Trust:** Never trust, always verify
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Require MFA** for all user accounts
- **Support multiple MFA methods** (SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
- **Enforce MFA** on all sensitive operations
- **Graceful MFA failure handling** with clear user guidance
- **MFA bypass procedures** for emergency access

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Implement granular roles** based on job functions
- **Dynamic role assignment** based on context
- **Role inheritance** for hierarchical organizations
- **Temporary role elevation** for specific tasks
- **Regular role reviews** and access audits

### Session Management
- **Secure session tokens** with appropriate expiration
- **Session timeout** for inactivity
- **Concurrent session limits** per user
- **Session invalidation** on logout
- **Session monitoring** for suspicious activity

## Data Protection

### Data Classification
- **Classify data** by sensitivity level (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- **Apply appropriate controls** based on classification
- **Data labeling** and handling procedures
- **Data retention policies** by classification
- **Data disposal procedures** for sensitive data

### Encryption Standards
- **Encryption at rest** for all sensitive data
- **Encryption in transit** using TLS 1.3
- **Key management** with Azure Key Vault
- **Database encryption** for all stored data
- **File encryption** for uploaded documents

### Data Privacy
- **Privacy by Design** principles implementation
- **Data minimization** - collect only necessary data
- **User consent** management for data processing
- **Data portability** and export capabilities
- **Right to be forgotten** implementation

## API Security

### API Authentication
- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times
- **Refresh token rotation** for security
- **API key management** for external integrations
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **API versioning** for security updates

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Validate all inputs** using Zod schemas
- **Sanitize user inputs** to prevent injection attacks
- **Parameterized queries** for database operations
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **Input length limits** and validation rules

### API Security Headers
```typescript
// Security headers configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true,
  },
}));
```

## Infrastructure Security

### Azure Security Configuration
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** for traffic control
- **Azure Firewall** for application protection
- **Private endpoints** for database access
- **Azure DDoS Protection** for availability
- **Azure Security Center** for monitoring

### Container Security
- **Scan container images** for vulnerabilities
- **Use minimal base images** (Alpine Linux)
- **Run containers as non-root** users
- **Implement resource limits** for containers
- **Regular security updates** for base images

### Database Security
- **Database firewall rules** for access control
- **Encrypted connections** to database
- **Database user permissions** with least privilege
- **Regular database backups** with encryption
- **Database activity monitoring** and logging

## Application Security

### Secure Development Practices
- **Code security reviews** for all changes
- **Static code analysis** with security focus
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**
- **Secure coding guidelines** enforcement
- **Security testing** in CI/CD pipeline

### Error Handling & Logging
- **Secure error messages** (no sensitive data exposure)
- **Structured logging** with security events
- **Log integrity** and tamper detection
- **Log retention** and archival policies
- **Security event correlation** and alerting

### Security Monitoring
- **Real-time security monitoring** with Azure Sentinel
- **Anomaly detection** for user behavior
- **Security incident response** procedures
- **Threat intelligence** integration
- **Security metrics** and reporting

## Compliance Requirements

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001** Information Security Management

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Data protection regulations** (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Industry-specific regulations** for mining, petrochemicals, defence
- **Export control regulations** for defence industry
- **Environmental regulations** for high-risk industries
- **Safety regulations** for critical infrastructure

## Security Testing

### Penetration Testing
- **Regular penetration testing** by external security firms
