   - Basic critical control identification and mapping
   - Bowtie analysis functionality
   - Control-process linking

2. **Process Management and Documentation (Core)**
   - Basic process mapping and documentation
   - Visual process designer
   - Version control for process documents

3. **Basic Analytics and Reporting (Core)**
   - Simple dashboards
   - Basic report generation
   - Data visualisation

4. **Strategic Navigation Flow Foundation (Core)**
   - Process Maps to Service Model navigation
   - Strategic context panels in process views
   - Basic alignment indicators
   - Navigation breadcrumbs and flow structure

## Development Guidelines by Phase

### Phase 1 Guidelines
- **Focus on core functionality** over polish
- **Implement basic CRUD operations** for all entities
- **Use simple, functional UI** (no advanced styling yet)
- **Prioritise database schema** and data relationships
- **Implement basic authentication** (no RBAC yet)
- **Focus on backend APIs** and data flow
- **Visualize implementation status** - clearly mark non-functional components
- **Maintain transparency** - show real vs. mock data to users
- **Establish navigation flow foundation** - connect operational to strategic layers

### Phase 2 Guidelines (MVP - 8-12 weeks)
- **Implement RBAC** and security features
- **Enhance UI/UX** with proper styling and accessibility
- **Add real-time monitoring** capabilities
- **Implement Azure deployment** pipeline
- **Add comprehensive testing** coverage
- **Focus on customer-ready features**
- **Complete strategic navigation flow** - Service Model, Value Chain, Operating Model
- **Implement alignment scoring** and traceability metrics

### Phase 3 Guidelines (Extended Rollout - 6-12 months)
- **Advanced analytics** and AI/ML features
- **External system integrations** (ERP, MES, etc.)
- **Advanced reporting** and dashboards
- **Performance optimization** and scaling
- **Advanced security** features
- **Advanced navigation features** - AI-powered recommendations, automated alignment

## Decision Making Framework

### When Implementing Features
1. **Check current phase** - Ensure feature aligns with phase goals
2. **Validate against backlog** - Confirm feature is in current phase
3. **Consider dependencies** - Implement prerequisites first
4. **Focus on core value** - Prioritise features that demonstrate platform value
5. **Maintain quality** - Don't sacrifice code quality for speed
6. **Mark implementation status** - Clearly indicate functional vs. non-functional components
7. **Update progress tracking** - Keep implementation metrics current
8. **Plan navigation integration** - Consider strategic layer connections

### When Making Technical Decisions
1. **Phase-appropriate complexity** - Don't over-engineer for current phase
2. **Future-proofing** - Consider how decisions impact future phases
3. **Scalability** - Ensure architecture supports future growth
4. **Maintainability** - Write code that can be enhanced in future phases
5. **Navigation architecture** - Design for strategic layer integration
