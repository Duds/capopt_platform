## Framework Relationships

### üîó **Hierarchical Dependencies**

```
Industry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sectors (COMMODITY, VALUE_CHAIN, BUSINESS_MODEL, SUPPORT_SERVICES)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operational Streams (EXTRACTION, PROCESSING, SAFETY, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Facility Types (MINE, PROCESSING_PLANT, REFINERY, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Compliance Requirements (WHS_ACT, ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Regulatory Framework (ICMM, ISO_9001, ISO_14001, etc.)
```

### üîÑ **Auto-Population Logic**

1. **Industry Selection** ‚Üí Filters available sectors
2. **Sector Selection** ‚Üí Auto-populates relevant operational streams
3. **Sector Selection** ‚Üí Auto-populates applicable facility types
4. **Sector Selection** ‚Üí Auto-populates compliance requirements
5. **Sector Selection** ‚Üí Auto-populates regulatory frameworks

### üéõÔ∏è **Manual Override Capability**

- Users can manually add/remove framework items
- Auto-applied items can be converted to manual
- Manual items can be converted to auto-applied
- Framework associations track the source (auto vs manual)

## Database Structure

### üìä **Framework Association Models**

```sql
-- Business Canvas Framework Associations
BusinessCanvasOperationalStreams {
  id: String
  businessCanvasId: String
  operationalStreamId: String
  isAutoApplied: Boolean  // Tracks if auto-applied or manually added
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}

BusinessCanvasComplianceFrameworks {
  id: String
  businessCanvasId: String
  complianceFrameworkId: String
  isAutoApplied: Boolean

## Business Canvas Integration

### üéØ **Framework Selection Process**

1. **User selects Industry** (e.g., "Mining & Metals")
2. **User selects Sectors** (e.g., "COPPER", "GOLD", "PRODUCTION")
3. **System auto-populates**:
   - Operational Streams relevant to selected sectors
   - Facility Types appropriate for industry/sectors
   - Compliance Requirements based on sectors
   - Regulatory Frameworks applicable to sectors
4. **User can manually**:
   - Add additional framework items
   - Remove auto-applied items
   - Modify framework selections

### üìà **Framework Benefits**

1. **Industry-Specific Guidance**: Frameworks are tailored to specific industries
2. **Sector-Based Relevance**: Only relevant frameworks are suggested
3. **Compliance Assurance**: Ensures all necessary compliance requirements are covered
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlines framework selection process
5. **Risk Management**: Comprehensive coverage of operational risks
6. **Audit Readiness**: Clear framework associations for audit purposes
