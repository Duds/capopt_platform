- **Result**: Operating Model is now accessible as the second item in the Strategic Layer section

### 2. **Type Definitions**
- **File**: `components/operating-model/types.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all operating model components
  - 5 main sections: Value Chains, Service Models, Experience Models, Capability Models, Operating Principles
  - Detailed sub-interfaces for each component type
  - Consistent with Business Model Canvas patterns
  - Default operating model structure

### 3. **Utility Functions**
- **File**: `components/operating-model/utils.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Section definitions with icons, colors, and descriptions
  - Color utility functions for different types and priorities
  - Icon mapping for various component types
  - Helper functions for completeness calculation, validation, and export
  - Consistent with Business Model Canvas utility patterns

### 4. **Main Component**
- **File**: `components/operating-model/OperatingModelCanvas.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Canvas and List view modes
  - Edit and View modes with toggle functionality
  - Progress indicator showing completeness percentage
  - Export functionality (JSON, PDF, CSV - PDF/CSV placeholders)
  - Share functionality (placeholder for future implementation)
  - Responsive grid layout for canvas sections
  - Empty state handling with add buttons
  - Item management (add, edit, delete) with toast notifications
  - Consistent styling with Business Model Canvas

### 5. **Main Page Integration**
- **File**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added Operating Model Canvas import
  - Added operating model state management
  - Integrated Operating Model Canvas component
  - Removed operating-model from placeholder content
  - Maintains same view mode and editing state as Business Model Canvas

- **Export Functionality**: JSON export (PDF/CSV placeholders)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches Business Model Canvas design
- **Empty States**: Clear empty state handling with add buttons
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for actions

### üîÑ **Shared State Management**
- Uses same `viewMode` and `isEditing` state as Business Model Canvas
- Consistent user experience across both canvases
- Shared export and share functionality patterns

### üé® **Visual Design**
- Color-coded sections for easy identification
- Consistent iconography throughout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Professional, clean interface
- Accessibility considerations

## Technical Implementation

### **Component Patterns**
- Follows same patterns as Business Model Canvas
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent type definitions
- Similar state management approach
- Same UI component usage

### **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Type-safe utility functions
- Consistent error handling

### **Performance**
- Efficient rendering with React hooks
- Memoized calculations for completeness
- Optimized re-renders
- Lazy loading ready

## Usage

### **Accessing the Operating Model Canvas**
1. Navigate to the CapOpt Platform
2. Click on "Operating Model" in the Strategic Layer section of the sidebar
3. The Operating Model Canvas will load with 5 empty sections

### **Using the Canvas**
1. **Toggle Edit Mode**: Click "Edit Mode" button to enable editing
2. **Add Items**: Click "+" buttons in each section to add new items
3. **Switch Views**: Toggle between Canvas and List views
4. **Export**: Use the Export button to download as JSON
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor completeness percentage

### **Section Management**
- Each section can contain multiple items
- Items have types, priorities, and maturity levels
- Consistent editing interface across all sections
- Real-time updates and validation

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Database Integration**: Connect to Prisma schema
- **API Endpoints**: Create REST API for operating model data
- **Template System**: Pre-built operating model templates
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities
