## GitHub Issues to Create

### Issue 1: Fix Export/Share Foreign Key Constraints
**Title:** Fix Export and Share Foreign Key Constraint Violations
**Labels:** `bug`, `high-priority`, `authentication`
**Description:** Both export and share functionality are failing due to foreign key constraint violations on user references.

### Issue 2: Implement Canvas Export File Generation
**Title:** Implement Canvas Export File Generation for All Formats
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `export`, `file-generation`
**Description:** Currently only JSON export works. Need to implement actual file generation for PDF, PNG, SVG, CSV, and EXCEL formats.

### Issue 3: Implement Canvas Share Email Functionality
**Title:** Implement Email Sending for Canvas Sharing
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `share`, `email`
**Description:** Email sharing creates database records but doesn't actually send emails. Need to implement email service integration.

### Issue 4: Implement Canvas Share Team Functionality
**Title:** Implement Team Notifications for Canvas Sharing
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `share`, `team`
**Description:** Team sharing creates database records but doesn't notify team members. Need to implement team notification system.

### Issue 5: Add Export and Share Analytics
**Title:** Add Analytics for Export and Share Functionality
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `analytics`, `monitoring`
**Description:** Add usage tracking, performance monitoring, and user behavior analytics for export and share features.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "puppeteer": "^21.0.0",
  "jspdf": "^2.5.0",
  "xlsx": "^0.18.0",
  "canvas": "^2.11.0",
  "nodemailer": "^6.9.0",
  "@sendgrid/mail": "^7.7.0"
}
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Email Service
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@capopt.com

# File Storage (for generated files)
AWS_S3_BUCKET=capopt-exports
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
```

### Database Considerations
- Consider adding indexes on `canvas_exports.exportedById` and `canvas_sharing_settings.businessCanvasId`
- Add soft delete for export and share records
- Consider archiving old export/share records

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All export formats generate actual files
- [ ] Email sharing sends actual emails
- [ ] Team sharing notifies team members
- [ ] No foreign key constraint violations
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large canvases
