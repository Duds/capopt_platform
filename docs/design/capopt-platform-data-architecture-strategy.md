## üß≠ Recommended Data Architecture Strategy for High-Risk Industry Operating Models

This strategy supports the end-to-end modelling and management of complex, high-risk operations across industries such as Mining, Defence, Petrochemicals, and Pharmaceuticals. It provides a scalable foundation to map, govern, and extend across business lines, operating models, process frameworks, and real-world systems like ERP, MES, and RCM.

### 1. üß± Core Architectural Pattern: Graph-Relational Hybrid

- **Relational for integrity**: Use PostgreSQL for core entities with strong referential integrity, reporting, and governance.
- **Graph for flexibility**: Use edge tables (or Apache AGE if needed) for complex interrelationships between nodes such as processes, risks, controls, and systems.
- **`jsonb` for adaptability**: Model metadata-rich nodes with embedded attributes (e.g., metrics, dependencies, state).
- **`ltree` or recursive CTEs**: Model deep hierarchies (e.g. Business Lines, Playbook steps, Risk maps).

### 2. üß© Conceptual Data Stack

```text
Business Line
  ‚Ü≥ Business Model Canvas (BMC)
     ‚Ü≥ Operating Model Canvas (OMC)
        ‚Ü≥ Process Library
           ‚Ü≥ Process Maps (linked to roles/systems)
              ‚Ü≥ Playbooks (task-level procedures)
                 ‚Ü≥ ControlOps (live checks, monitoring)
                    ‚Ü≥ BowtieLab (causality/risk paths)
                       ‚Ü≥ RiskMap (mitigation + exposure views)
                          ‚Ü≥ ERP / MES / RCM (system events, status, cost)
```

Each layer provides:
- **Deeper operational fidelity**
- **Increased system connectivity**
- **More rigorous control and assurance links**

### 3. üîó Key Data Structures

#### a. `nodes` (polymorphic, canonical)
```sql
nodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT, -- 'activity', 'canvas_card', 'control', etc.
  label TEXT,
  metadata JSONB
)
```

#### b. `edges` (relationships between nodes)
```sql
edges (
  from_id UUID,
  to_id UUID,
  relation_type TEXT, -- 'delivers', 'mitigates', 'depends_on'
  metadata JSONB
)
```

#### c. `entities` (stable master data)
- business_units
- locations
- partners
- applications
- roles
- capabilities
- hazards
- controls
- standards

---

### 4. üìö Master Data & Reuse

- Centralise all reusable concepts (roles, systems, vendors, hazards, controls)
- Use ID references across all layers to avoid duplication
- Allow nodes to **inherit** and **extend** master templates (e.g. BL-specific process derived from global standard)

### 5. üåê Integration Readiness

| System | Interface           | Use Cases                            |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| ERP    | API / ETL           | Budget, resourcing, procurement      |
| MES    | OPC-UA / Kafka      | Operational metrics, equipment state |
| RCM    | API / shared tables | Maintenance, reliability, schedules  |
| BI     | Materialised views  | Reporting, compliance, visualisation |

---

### 6. üõ°Ô∏è Risk and Control Model

- BowtieLab nodes define causality from hazard ‚Üí consequence
- Controls stored as nodes and linked via `mitigates`, `monitors`, `detects`
- Playbooks link back to control and risk nodes to validate operational readiness
- RiskMap nodes summarise exposure and status across the operating model

---

### 7. üéØ Deployment Principles

- **Separation of structure and state**: Store model structure (nodes, edges) independently from real-time performance data
- **Traceable governance**: All master data, mappings, and overrides version-controlled
- **Composable UI**: Frontend canvas components load/save from backend using typed API contracts
- **Federated extension**: Allow specific BLs or business units to extend core models without corrupting lineage
