## Overview

The CapOpt Platform is a comprehensive operational capability optimisation system designed for high-risk industries (mining, minerals, petrochemicals, defence). The platform embeds Critical Controls Theory across all organisational layers, ensuring risk and control are central to every decision and process.

### Key Principles

- **Critical Controls Theory-Led:** Risk management and control assurance at every layer
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Compliance with WHS, ISO, ICMM, and defence standards
- **Operational Assurance:** Real-time visibility and monitoring of critical controls
- **Strategic Integration:** Alignment of business objectives with operational reality

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18+, Next.js 15+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js/Fastify, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma, JWT
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Cloud Services
- **Analytics:** Data Warehouse, ETL Pipelines, BI Tools, AI/ML Engine

## Extended Design Documents

- [Reference Architecture: Controls-Led Platform for High-Risk Industries](./reference-architecture.md)
- [Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy for High-Risk Industries](./gtm-strategy.md)
- [Regulatory Standards Mapping](./regulatory-standards-mapping.md)
- [Strategic Navigation Flow](./strategic-navigation-flow.md)

Refer to these documents for detailed architecture, strategy, compliance, and value proposition information tailored to mining, minerals, petrochemicals, and defence sectors.

## Cursor Rules and Development Guidelines

### Design Document Integration

When making development decisions or implementing features, **ALWAYS** reference and follow the established design documents:

1. **Why Statement** - Use for:
   - Understanding the platform's purpose and motivation
   - Aligning features with the overall vision
   - Making decisions that support the mission
   - Ensuring stakeholder value delivery

2. **Problem Statement** - Use for:
   - Understanding what problems features should solve
   - Validating that solutions address real needs
   - Prioritizing features based on problem impact
   - Measuring success against problem resolution

3. **Solution Architecture Design (SAD)** - Use for:
   - Database schema decisions
   - API design patterns
   - Integration approaches
   - System component architecture
   - Error handling strategies

4. **UX Architecture Design** - Use for:
   - User interface patterns
   - User journey flows
   - Component design decisions
   - Accessibility considerations
   - User experience consistency

5. **Reference Architecture** - Use for:
   - Layered architecture decisions
   - Control & Risk vertical implementation
   - Industry-specific requirements
   - Regulatory compliance patterns

6. **Product Backlog** - Use for:
   - Feature prioritisation
   - User story implementation
   - Phase-appropriate development
   - Success criteria validation

### Documentation as Code Practices

Following the [Docs as Code philosophy](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), this project implements documentation using the same tools and workflows as code development:

#### Core Principles

- **Version Control:** All documentation is stored in Git alongside code
- **Plain Text Markup:** Documentation uses Markdown format
- **Code Reviews:** Documentation changes require review before merging
- **Automated Tests:** Documentation is validated and tested
- **Issue Tracking:** Documentation tasks are tracked in the same system as code

#### Documentation Workflow

1. **Create Documentation Issues:** Track documentation needs alongside feature development
2. **Write Documentation:** Use Markdown format with consistent structure
3. **Review Process:** Documentation changes go through the same review process as code
4. **Automated Validation:** Ensure links work, formatting is correct, and content is complete
5. **Version Control:** Tag documentation releases with code releases

#### Documentation Standards

- **Consistency:** Use established templates and formats
- **Clarity:** Write for the intended audience (developers, stakeholders, users)
- **Completeness:** Ensure all features have corresponding documentation
- **Currency:** Keep documentation updated with code changes
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility guidelines for documentation

#### Integration with Development

- **Feature Documentation:** New features must include documentation before merging
- **API Documentation:** All APIs must be documented with examples
- **Architecture Updates:** Significant architectural changes require documentation updates
- **User Guides:** User-facing features require user documentation
- **Technical Guides:** Complex implementations require technical documentation

### Development Decision Framework

When implementing any feature or making architectural decisions:

1. **Check Why Statement:** Ensure the feature aligns with the platform's purpose and vision
2. **Validate Problem Statement:** Confirm the feature addresses a real problem
3. **Check Design Documents:** Review relevant sections of SAD, UXD, and Reference Architecture
4. **Validate Against Backlog:** Ensure implementation aligns with prioritised features
5. **Update Documentation:** Modify design documents if implementation reveals new requirements
6. **Follow Documentation as Code:** Update documentation alongside code changes
7. **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure decisions align with established patterns and principles

### Quality Assurance

- **Documentation Reviews:** All documentation changes require peer review
- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure documentation references are accurate and current
- **User Testing:** Validate that documentation meets user needs
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and improve documentation quality
