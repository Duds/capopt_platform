# CapOpt Platform - Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Documentation

## Overview

The CapOpt Platform database is designed around a layered architecture that embeds Critical Controls Theory (CCT) across all organisational layers. The database schema supports high-risk industries (mining, minerals, petrochemicals, defence) with comprehensive risk management and operational capability optimisation.

**New Data Architecture**: The platform now implements a **Graph-Relational Hybrid** architecture that combines the integrity of relational databases with the flexibility of graph structures for complex interrelationships.

## Key Relationships

### Cross-Layer Integration
The database design emphasizes cross-layer relationships to ensure risk and control are embedded throughout:

1. **Enterprise â†’ Strategic**: Business canvases are linked to enterprise structure with graph relationships
2. **Strategic â†’ Control**: Bowtie models link to business canvas elements with graph-based mapping
3. **Operational â†’ Control**: Processes and assets are linked to critical controls with graph relationships
4. **Control â†’ Risk**: Risk propagation engine monitors all layers with graph-based analysis

### Graph-Relational Relationships
Several cross-entity relationship patterns enable flexible associations:

- **ProcessControl**: Links processes to critical controls with graph edges
- **AssetControl**: Links assets to critical controls with graph relationships
- **ProcessPlaybook**: Links processes to operational playbooks with graph flows
- **RiskPropagation**: Links risk signals across layers with graph-based propagation paths

### Many-to-Many Relationships
Traditional many-to-many relationships are enhanced with graph capabilities:

- **ProcessControl**: Enhanced with graph-based effectiveness tracking
- **AssetControl**: Enhanced with graph-based protection mapping
- **ProcessPlaybook**: Enhanced with graph-based workflow execution
- **UserRole**: Enhanced with graph-based permission inheritance

## Database Design Principles

### 1. Graph-Relational Hybrid Integration
- Every operational element can be linked to critical controls via graph relationships
- Risk assessment is embedded at all levels with graph-based propagation
- Verification and compliance tracking throughout with graph-based audit trails
- Flexible relationship modeling without schema changes

### 2. Hierarchical Organisation
- **LTREE Extension**: For PostgreSQL hierarchical path storage
- **Recursive CTEs**: For complex hierarchical queries
- **Graph Traversal**: For relationship path analysis
- **Hybrid Queries**: Combining relational and graph patterns

### 3. Master Data Centralization
- **Centralized Master Data**: Single source of truth for roles, systems, vendors, hazards, controls
- **Reference-Based Relationships**: Use ID references across all layers to avoid duplication
- **Template Inheritance**: Allow entities to inherit and extend master templates
- **Graph-Based Master Data**: Master data entities with graph relationship capabilities

### 4. Metadata-Rich Entities
- **JSONB Storage**: Rich attribute storage for extensible entities
- **Schema Flexibility**: Industry-specific requirements without schema changes
- **Performance Optimization**: GIN indexing for metadata queries
- **Version Control**: Metadata evolution with backward compatibility

## Graph-Relational Query Patterns

### Hybrid Queries
```sql
-- Find all processes that control a specific risk
SELECT n2.label as process_name, e.metadata as control_details
FROM nodes n1
JOIN edges e ON n1.id = e.from_id
JOIN nodes n2 ON e.to_id = n2.id
WHERE n1.type = 'risk' 
  AND n1.label = 'Equipment Failure'
  AND e.relation_type = 'controls'
  AND n2.type = 'process';

-- Find risk propagation paths
WITH RECURSIVE risk_paths AS (
  SELECT from_id, to_id, relation_type, 1 as depth
  FROM edges 
  WHERE from_id = (SELECT id FROM nodes WHERE type = 'risk' AND label = 'Equipment Failure')
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.from_id, e.to_id, e.relation_type, rp.depth + 1
  FROM edges e
  JOIN risk_paths rp ON e.from_id = rp.to_id
  WHERE rp.depth < 5
)
SELECT * FROM risk_paths;
```

### Hierarchical Queries
```sql
-- Find all business units under a facility
SELECT * FROM business_units 
WHERE hierarchy_path <@ (SELECT hierarchy_path FROM facilities WHERE id = 'facility_id');

-- Find all processes in a business unit hierarchy
SELECT * FROM processes 
WHERE hierarchy_path <@ (SELECT hierarchy_path FROM business_units WHERE id = 'business_unit_id');
```

### Metadata Queries
```sql
-- Find all controls with high effectiveness
SELECT * FROM nodes 
WHERE type = 'critical_control' 
  AND metadata->>'effectiveness'::numeric > 0.8;

-- Find all processes with specific risk level
SELECT * FROM nodes 
WHERE type = 'process' 
  AND metadata->>'risk_level' = 'high';
```

## Performance Optimization

### Graph Indexes
```sql
-- Graph indexes for efficient traversal
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_type_label ON nodes USING GIN (type, label);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_relation_type ON edges USING GIN (relation_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_metadata ON edges USING GIN (metadata);
```

### Hierarchical Indexes
```sql
-- Hierarchical indexes for LTREE
CREATE INDEX idx_business_canvas_hierarchy ON business_canvases USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_operating_model_hierarchy ON operating_models USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_process_hierarchy ON processes USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_enterprise_hierarchy ON enterprises USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_facility_hierarchy ON facilities USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_business_unit_hierarchy ON business_units USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_department_hierarchy ON departments USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
```

### JSONB Indexes
```sql
-- JSONB indexes for metadata queries
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_metadata ON nodes USING GIN (metadata);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_metadata ON edges USING GIN (metadata);
```

## Integration Readiness

### External System Integration
| System | Interface | Data Types | Graph Integration |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| ERP | API / ETL | Budget, resourcing, procurement | Cost center relationships |
| MES | OPC-UA / Kafka | Operational metrics, equipment state | Real-time process flows |
| RCM | API / shared tables | Maintenance, reliability, schedules | Asset dependency graphs |
| BI | Materialised views | Reporting, compliance, visualisation | Risk propagation paths |

### Graph-Relational Integration Patterns
```sql
-- Integration nodes for external systems
INSERT INTO nodes (id, type, label, metadata) VALUES
  (erp_id, 'external_system', 'SAP_ERP', {
    'system_type': 'erp',
    'integration_type': 'api_etl',
    'sync_frequency': 'hourly'
  });

-- Integration relationships
INSERT INTO edges (from_id, to_id, relation_type, metadata) VALUES
  (erp_id, cost_center_id, 'provides_data', {'data_type': 'budget'}),
  (mes_id, process_id, 'monitors', {'frequency': 'real_time'}),
  (rcm_id, asset_id, 'maintains', {'maintenance_type': 'preventive'});
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Graph-Relational Data Flow
```sql
-- Data flow nodes
INSERT INTO nodes (id, type, label, metadata) VALUES
  (data_flow_id, 'data_flow', 'operational_to_strategic', {
    'source_layer': 'operational',
    'target_layer': 'strategic',
    'flow_type': 'risk_propagation'
  });

-- Data flow relationships
INSERT INTO edges (from_id, to_id, relation_type, metadata) VALUES
  (operational_data_id, tactical_data_id, 'flows_to', {'delay': '1_hour'}),
  (tactical_data_id, strategic_data_id, 'flows_to', {'delay': '24_hours'}),
  (external_system_id, operational_data_id, 'provides', {'frequency': 'real_time'});
```
