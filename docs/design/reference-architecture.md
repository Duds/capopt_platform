# Reference Architecture: Controls-Led Platform for High-Risk Industries

The CapOpt Platform is architected to embed Critical Controls Theory across all organisational layers, ensuring risk and control are central to every decision and process. This architecture is tailored for mining, minerals, petrochemicals, and defence sectors.

## Layered Architecture

1. **Strategic Layer**
   - Aligns business objectives and strategy with critical risk controls
   - Integrates board-level risk appetite and regulatory mandates
   - Enables bowtie analysis and critical control mapping at the strategic level

2. **Value/Service Layer**
   - Connects value delivery and service models to critical controls
   - Ensures that value chains are protected by effective controls
   - Maps service delivery risks and embeds controls into value streams

3. **Architectural Layer**
   - Designs systems, processes, and assets with controls as a core design principle
   - Integrates risk and control requirements into solution and process architecture
   - Supports assurance, audit, and compliance by design

4. **Operational Layer**
   - Embeds critical controls into daily operations, procedures, and playbooks
   - Provides real-time monitoring, incident response, and assurance workflows
   - Enables continuous improvement and learning from incidents

**Control & Risk Vertical**
- Spans all layers, ensuring that risk and control are not siloed but are integrated throughout the organisation
- Supports real-time risk visibility, assurance, and regulatory compliance
