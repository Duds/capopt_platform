## Data Architecture Patterns

### Graph-Relational Hybrid Pattern
```sql
-- Core graph structure
CREATE TABLE nodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  label TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE edges (
  from_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id),
  to_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id),
  relation_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (from_id, to_id, relation_type)
);

-- Hierarchical structure with LTREE
ALTER TABLE business_canvases ADD COLUMN hierarchy_path LTREE;
ALTER TABLE operating_models ADD COLUMN hierarchy_path LTREE;
ALTER TABLE processes ADD COLUMN hierarchy_path LTREE;
```

### Hybrid Query Patterns
```typescript
// Service layer for hybrid queries
export class GraphRelationalService {
  async getProcessWithControls(processId: string) {
    // Relational query for core data
    const process = await prisma.process.findUnique({
      where: { id: processId },
      include: { steps: true, metrics: true }
    });
    
    // Graph query for relationships
    const controls = await this.graphQuery(`
      MATCH (p:Process {id: $processId})-[:controls]->(c:Control)
      RETURN c
    `);
    
    return { ...process, controls };
  }
  
  async getRiskPropagationPath(riskId: string) {
    // Graph traversal for risk propagation
    return await this.graphQuery(`
      WITH RECURSIVE risk_paths AS (
        SELECT from_id, to_id, relation_type, 1 as depth
        FROM edges 
        WHERE from_id = $riskId
        UNION ALL
        SELECT e.from_id, e.to_id, e.relation_type, rp.depth + 1
        FROM edges e
        JOIN risk_paths rp ON e.from_id = rp.to_id
        WHERE rp.depth < 5
      )
      SELECT * FROM risk_paths
    `);
  }
}
```

### Master Data Integration
```typescript
// Centralized master data with graph relationships
interface MasterDataNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'role' | 'system' | 'vendor' | 'hazard' | 'control' | 'standard';
  label: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  graphNodeId?: string; // Reference to graph node
}

// Reference-based relationships
interface OperationalCanvas extends BusinessCanvas {
  operationalMode: true;
  operationalParentId: string; // Reference to business canvas
  processMaps: ProcessMap[]; // References to process maps
  inheritedData: {
    industry: string; // Reference to existing
    sectors: string[]; // Reference to existing
    facilityTypes: string[]; // Reference to existing
  };
}
```

## Performance and Scalability

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Graph indexes for efficient traversal
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_type_label ON nodes USING GIN (type, label);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_relation_type ON edges USING GIN (relation_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_metadata ON edges USING GIN (metadata);

-- Hierarchical indexes for LTREE
CREATE INDEX idx_business_canvas_hierarchy ON business_canvases USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_operating_model_hierarchy ON operating_models USING GIST (hierarchy_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_process_hierarchy ON processes USING GIST (hierarchy_path);

-- JSONB indexes for metadata queries
CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_metadata ON nodes USING GIN (metadata);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_metadata ON edges USING GIN (metadata);
```

### Caching Strategy
