- **Tree View**: Status indicators in canvas tree view

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Engine
```typescript
// Example usage
const validation = CanvasStatusValidator.validateStatusTransition({
  canvas: canvasData,
  contentCounts: { valuePropositions: 3, customerSegments: 2, ... },
  userRole: 'MANAGER',
  currentStatus: 'DRAFT',
  targetStatus: 'REVIEW'
})
```

### Status Information
```typescript
// Get display information for any status
const statusInfo = CanvasStatusValidator.getStatusInfo('PUBLISHED')
// Returns: { label: 'Published', description: '...', color: '...', icon: '...' }
```

### Available Transitions
```typescript
// Get allowed transitions for user role
const transitions = CanvasStatusValidator.getAvailableStatusTransitions('MANAGER', 'DRAFT')
// Returns: ['REVIEW', 'ARCHIVED']
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Canvas Tree View
- Status change menu item in dropdown
- Integration with status dialog
- Proper state management

### 2. Breadcrumbs Component
- Status display in navigation
- Visual status indicators
- Consistent styling

### 3. Clone Functionality
- Automatic DRAFT status assignment
- Business rule compliance
- No additional user intervention required

### 4. API Integration
- Status updates via existing API endpoints

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **DRAFT → REVIEW**: Test with incomplete canvas (should fail validation)
2. **DRAFT → REVIEW**: Test with complete canvas (should succeed)
3. **REVIEW → PUBLISHED**: Test with missing strategic fields (should fail)
4. **REVIEW → PUBLISHED**: Test with complete canvas (should succeed)
5. **Clone Canvas**: Verify new canvas starts as DRAFT
6. **Role Permissions**: Test different user roles and their allowed transitions

### Validation Testing
- Content count validation
- Field completeness validation
- Role-based permission validation
- Status transition validation
- Error message accuracy

## Future Enhancements
