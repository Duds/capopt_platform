# Canvas Form Consolidation

## Overview

The `NewCanvasForm` and `EditCanvasForm` components have been consolidated into a single `CanvasForm` component to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Consolidated Component
- **File**: `components/business-canvas/canvas-form.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Single form component that handles both create and edit modes
- **Features**:
  - Mode-based rendering (`create` | `edit`)
  - Dynamic titles and descriptions based on mode
  - Consistent validation and data handling
  - Step-by-step form progression
  - Database-driven industry/sector selection
  - **Modal dialog wrapper** for proper overlay display

### 2. Updated Usage
- **Canvas Visualization**: Updated to use `CanvasForm` with `mode="create"`
- **Canvas Tree View**: Updated to use `CanvasForm` with `mode="edit"`

### 3. Removed Files
- `components/business-canvas/new-canvas-form.tsx` (deleted)
- `components/business-canvas/edit-canvas-form.tsx` (deleted)

## Component Interface

```typescript
interface CanvasFormProps {
  mode: 'create' | 'edit'
  onSubmit: (businessInfo: BusinessInformation) => void
  canvasId?: string // Only needed for edit mode
  canvasData?: any // Only needed for edit mode
  enterpriseContext?: any
  isOpen: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Code Reuse**: Single source of truth for form logic
2. **Consistency**: Same validation, styling, and behavior across modes
3. **Maintainability**: Changes only need to be made in one place
4. **Type Safety**: Consistent TypeScript interfaces
5. **User Experience**: Consistent UI patterns and interactions

## Form Steps

The consolidated form maintains the same 4-step structure:

1. **Business Information**: Name, legal details, industry, sectors
2. **Strategic & Financial**: Objectives, value proposition, revenue, employees
3. **Risk & Operations**: Risk profile, digital maturity, facility type
4. **Compliance & Regulatory**: Auto-generated based on sector selection

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API contracts
- Form validation and data handling remain identical
- Database operations unchanged
- UI/UX experience consistent
- **Fixed**: Edit modal now properly displays as overlay instead of embedded content

## Future Enhancements

The consolidated form provides a foundation for:
- Additional form modes (e.g., `clone`, `template`)
- Enhanced validation rules
- Improved accessibility features
- Better error handling
- Form state persistence
