# Sector Framework Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for improving the sector handling and framework relationships in the CapOpt Platform, addressing the issues identified by the user.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Sector Problems ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Missing Silver**: Silver was not available as a selection option
- **Wrong sector grouping**: All sectors were mixed together instead of being filtered by industry
- **Too many sectors**: Value chain showed sectors from all industries instead of just the selected industry

### 2. Framework Relationship Issues üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **No proper relationships**: Operational streams, compliance, and facilities are not properly linked to business canvases
- **Missing facility multi-select**: Facilities should be multi-select and auto-applied based on industry/sectors
- **No business canvas associations**: Framework selections are not recorded in the business canvas database

## Completed Fixes

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Sector Data and Filtering (COMPLETED)

#### 1.1 Updated Sector Seeding
- **File**: `prisma/seed/industries/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added missing `SILVER` sector
  - Added `GOLD_SILVER` combined sector (industry standard)
  - Reorganized sectors by proper categories (COMMODITY, VALUE_CHAIN, BUSINESS_MODEL, SUPPORT_SERVICES)
  - Made sectors industry-specific (no more cross-industry contamination)
  - Updated sector names to be more descriptive and industry-aligned

#### 1.2 Updated IndustrySectorSelector
- **File**: `components/business-canvas/IndustrySectorSelector.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `industryCode` prop to filter sectors by selected industry
  - Updated `categorizeSectors` function to filter by industry
  - Fixed sector selection logic to work with updated structure

#### 1.3 Updated CanvasEditor
- **File**: `components/business-canvas/CanvasEditor.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `industryCode` prop to `IndustrySectorSelector`
  - Passes `currentIndustryCode` to filter sectors properly

#### 1.4 Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `BusinessCanvasOperationalStreams` model for tracking operational stream associations
  - Added `BusinessCanvasComplianceFrameworks` model for tracking compliance framework associations
  - Added `BusinessCanvasFacilityTypes` model for tracking facility type associations
  - Added proper relationships between business canvases and framework items

## Current Status

### Phase 3: Facility Multi-Select (NEXT)

#### 3.1 Create Facility Multi-Select Component
- **Goal**: Replace single facility type with multi-select facility types
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `FacilityTypeMultiSelect` component similar to `IndustrySectorSelector`
  - Update `BusinessInformation` interface to use `facilityTypes: string[]`
  - Update database schema to support multiple facility types per business canvas

#### 3.2 Auto-Populate Facility Types
- **Goal**: Auto-populate facility types based on industry and selected sectors
- **Implementation**:
  - Update `useSectorRecommendations` hook to fetch facility types for industry/sectors
  - Modify auto-population logic in `CanvasEditor` to use sector-based recommendations
  - Add business canvas association creation when facility types are auto-applied

### Phase 4: Framework Management Interface (FUTURE)

#### 4.1 Create Framework Management Component
- **Goal**: Allow users to manually add/remove framework items
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `FrameworkManagement` component for operational streams, compliance, and facilities
  - Add "Add/Remove" functionality for each framework type
  - Show auto-applied vs manually added items

#### 4.2 Business Canvas Association Tracking
- **Goal**: Track which framework items are auto-applied vs manually added
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `isAutoApplied` field in framework association models
  - Update UI to show auto-applied vs manual items
  - Allow users to convert auto-applied items to manual (and vice versa)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
```sql
-- Business Canvas Framework Associations
BusinessCanvasOperationalStreams {
  id: String
  businessCanvasId: String
  operationalStreamId: String
  isAutoApplied: Boolean
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}

BusinessCanvasComplianceFrameworks {
  id: String
  businessCanvasId: String
  complianceFrameworkId: String
  isAutoApplied: Boolean
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}

BusinessCanvasFacilityTypes {
  id: String
  businessCanvasId: String
  facilityTypeId: String
  isAutoApplied: Boolean
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/business-canvas/{id}/framework-associations` - Get framework associations for a business canvas
- `POST /api/business-canvas/{id}/framework-associations` - Add framework associations
- `DELETE /api/business-canvas/{id}/framework-associations/{associationId}` - Remove framework associations
- `PUT /api/business-canvas/{id}/framework-associations/{associationId}` - Update framework association (auto-applied status)

### Component Structure
```
components/business-canvas/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IndustrySectorSelector.tsx ‚úÖ (Updated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FacilityTypeMultiSelect.tsx ‚è≥ (To be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FrameworkManagement.tsx ‚è≥ (To be created)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CanvasEditor.tsx ‚úÖ (Updated)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
