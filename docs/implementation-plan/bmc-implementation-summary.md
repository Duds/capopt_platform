## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. **Database Migration Planning**
```sql
-- Priority 1: Core BMC Section Enhancements
-- Start with Value Propositions and Customer Segments
ALTER TABLE value_propositions ADD COLUMN strategic_objective TEXT;
ALTER TABLE value_propositions ADD COLUMN competitive_advantage TEXT;
ALTER TABLE value_propositions ADD COLUMN target_customer_segment TEXT;
ALTER TABLE value_propositions ADD COLUMN operational_delivery_points TEXT[];
ALTER TABLE value_propositions ADD COLUMN critical_controls TEXT[];

ALTER TABLE customer_segments ADD COLUMN customer_type TEXT;
ALTER TABLE customer_segments ADD COLUMN geographic_region TEXT;
ALTER TABLE customer_segments ADD COLUMN revenue_potential DECIMAL;
ALTER TABLE customer_segments ADD COLUMN service_delivery_channels TEXT[];
```

### 2. **TypeScript Interface Updates**
```typescript
// Priority 1: Enhanced CanvasItem interface
export interface EnhancedCanvasItem extends CanvasItem {
  // Strategic Context
  strategicObjective?: string;
  competitiveAdvantage?: string;
  
  // Operational Integration
  operationalDeliveryPoints?: string[];
  processDependencies?: string[];
  
  // Risk & Control
  criticalControls?: string[];
  complianceRequirements?: string[];
  
  // Performance Metrics
  effectiveness?: string;
  efficiency?: number;
}
```

### 3. **API Route Enhancement**
```typescript
// Priority 1: Enhanced value propositions route
// app/api/business-canvas/[id]/value-propositions/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const body = await request.json();
  
  const enhancedValueProposition = await prisma.valueProposition.create({
    data: {
      businessCanvasId: params.id,
      description: body.description,
      priority: body.priority,
      // Enhanced fields
      strategicObjective: body.strategicObjective,
      competitiveAdvantage: body.competitiveAdvantage,
      targetCustomerSegment: body.targetCustomerSegment,
      operationalDeliveryPoints: body.operationalDeliveryPoints,
      criticalControls: body.criticalControls,
    }
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json(enhancedValueProposition);
}
```
